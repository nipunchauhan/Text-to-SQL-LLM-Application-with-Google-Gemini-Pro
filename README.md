# Text-to-SQL-LLM-Application-with-Google-Gemini-Pro
This is an end-to-end project that builds a "Text-to-SQL" application using Google's Gemini Pro LLM. The application allows non-technical users to ask complex questions in plain English, which are then converted into precise SQLite queries, executed against a soccer database, and the results are returned in a user-friendly interface.
